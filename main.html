    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It is an important aspect of writing efficient code, as it helps in predicting the performance and scalability of the algorithm. Efficient algorithms run faster and handle larger inputs better than inefficient ones.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm needs to run as a function of the length of the input. It is typically expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where n is the size of the input. Understanding Space Complexity is crucial for developing algorithms that not only run efficiently in terms of time but also use memory resources effectively.
